# Temporary Repository for Oldham Coupling simulation

Take a look at `oldham_coupling_continuous.m`. Thank you. 

Update: The code is ready for simulation tomorrow. You may take a look at it and adjust to your liking. However, note that, this simulation is a bit different from the mathematical model that we have built. Probably because the elliptical trammel didn't account for the movement of the middle flange.
